# What?
The Software Botany Sunlight project is a search framework built using Word Aligned Hybrid Bit Vectors. Its sole purpose is to provide high performance in-memory searching of data using unknown combinations of indices. It is developed with .NET 4.0 using C#. The core of this project, Word Aligned Hybrid Bit Vectors, is best explained at this website [FastBit An Efficient Compressed Bitmap Index Technology](http://crd.lbl.gov/~kewu/fastbit/index.html). In addition to implementing Word Aligned Hybrid Bit Vectors, this project layers on Catalogs (bitmap indices) and an entire Search Engine API.
## WARNING
WAH is protected by United States Patent 6831575 "Word aligned bitmap compression method, data structure, and apparatus".  However, FastBit is distributed under the [LGPL](http://crd.lbl.gov/~kewu/fastbit/src/license.txt) (and so is Sunlight), which has explicit language covering patents and royalty-free distribution in the preamble and section 11.  It is my understanding that derivative works are safe from patent infringement so long as they also follow the LGPL.  I am not a lawyer, and I do not know if you can use this library commercially. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**
